## Project Plan ##

Summary: Our project involves creating a tea shop web server using Spring, and interacting with the tea shop in various ways. These “various ways” would be a jukebox, or ordering a beverage, or a coronavirus case tracker in the area (just to name a few). Some of these would be independent due to simplicity, but could also involve collaboration to blow them up in proportion. For example, the coronavirus tracker may start out as just a text box but then be blown up into an animation.

This program uses a database to dynamically generate products and item in your cart. To add something to your cart, click the cart+ icon on the card for the product you want. The item then is generated in your cart array and stored in your cookies.

This site is a personalized chat system where I can manage users and chat rooms. Right now, you can send messages and images using this program. To send a message, type what you want to send and hit the "enter" key on your keyboard, or the arrow on the screen. To upload an image, hit the image icon on the message line and upload a file. This is a chat system created with API.

## Coronavirus Cases ##

This picture shows the home page and the table of coronavirus cases using HTML. The table was added to the index.html file for the home page. On the home page there will be a link saying "Get The San Diego Coronavirus Statistics From Our Built - In Database". This link leads to the database with these cases stored. So far an issue with this code is that the html table cannot automatically retrieve the number of coronavirus cases for each age group stored in the database. The table and the cases for each age group had to be manually entered into the table. Going back to the home page is the same as going back on any other page on the internet by clicking the back button.

This is what the contents of the database will look like.


## Delivery Plans and Content ##
