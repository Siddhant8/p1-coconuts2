## Project Plan ##

Summary: Our project involves creating a tea shop web server using Spring, and interacting with the tea shop in various ways. These “various ways” would be a jukebox, or ordering a beverage, or a coronavirus case tracker in the area (just to name a few). Some of these would be independent due to simplicity, but could also involve collaboration to blow them up in proportion. For example, the coronavirus tracker may start out as just a text box but then be blown up into an animation. 

## Delivery Plans and Content ##
Friday Plans: Update the scrum board with goals completed for the week to achieve the necessary goals for Night at the Museum. 

Night at the Museum: A spring website will be created through a local host. There will be a button to click for the tea shop, JukeBox, and coronavirus calculator.
