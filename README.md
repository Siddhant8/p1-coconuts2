## Project Plan ##

Summary: Our project involves creating a tea shop web server using Spring, and interacting with the tea shop in various ways. These “various ways” would be a jukebox, or ordering a beverage, or a coronavirus case tracker in the area (just to name a few). Some of these would be independent due to simplicity, but could also involve collaboration to blow them up in proportion. For example, the coronavirus tracker may start out as just a text box but then be blown up into an animation.

This program uses a database to dynamically generate products and item in your cart. To add something to your cart, click the cart+ icon on the card for the product you want. The item then is generated in your cart array and stored in your cookies.

This site is a personalized chat system where I can manage users and chat rooms. Right now, you can send messages and images using this program. To send a message, type what you want to send and hit the "enter" key on your keyboard, or the arrow on the screen. To upload an image, hit the image icon on the message line and upload a file. This is a chat system created with API.

## Coronavirus Cases ##
On the home page of the website there will be a table that shows the total number of coronavirus cases in San Diego County for each age group. Above the table there will be a line of text saying "Get The San Diego Coronavirus Statistics From Our Database here". That line of text will actually be a link. Please click that link to view the H2 in-memory database created. The cases for each age group in San Diego county were manually entered into this database.  

## Delivery Plans and Content ##
Friday Plans: Update the scrum board with goals completed for the week to achieve the necessary goals for Night at the Museum. 

Night at the Museum: A spring website will be created through a local host. There will be a button to click for the tea shop, JukeBox, and coronavirus calculator.
